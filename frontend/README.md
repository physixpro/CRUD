This was my first session that i fully understood how to use axios to send data to a NoSQL database (mongodb) successfully. I can now set up the entire server by myself and connect routes /end points without any help , and make Get request where i pull data from the database to the specific end points. I practice specific end points like those with placeholders for a more specific get Route , for e.g. if you want to pull up all the info from a particular user. The post request was done using a form and i understand now how the submit type within the button calls the onSubmit event listener in the form , this then runs the function and tells it to execute. Within the function contains my route to the end point where i want my data to be posted. 

Can't wait to do more!
